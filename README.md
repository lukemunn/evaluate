# Evaluate

*Evaluate* simplifies measuring and reporting on online child safety activities.

Users can select issues, theories of change and indicators to produce an evaluation framework. 

The framework can then be included in a PDF, to help assess whether an activity has been successful.

To run:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Launch a web server (e.g. [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)) in the repository's root directory.
3. Open http://localhost:8080 in your favourite browser.

For the list and grouping of indicators, *Evaluate* can use either of two data sources:

1. A Google Spreadsheet with indicators.
2. A CSV file.
